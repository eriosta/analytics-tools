These coefficients represent the estimated change in the log odds of purchasing a bike associated with a one unit increase in each predictor variable, holding all other predictors constant.

Some trends in the coefficients include:

MaritalStatusM is negatively associated with the likelihood of purchasing a bike, with an estimated coefficient of -0.371. This means that holding all other predictors constant, the log odds of purchasing a bike decrease by 0.371 when MaritalStatus is "Married".

The coefficients for some levels of the Education variable are not defined due to singularity, but the remaining levels indicate that the log odds of purchasing a bike increase by 0.169 for those with a Bachelor's degree and decrease by 0.531 for those with a Graduate degree, compared to those with only a high school education.

OccupationManagement and OccupationProfessional are negatively associated with the likelihood of purchasing a bike, with estimated coefficients of -0.615 and -0.368 respectively. This means that holding all other predictors constant, the log odds of purchasing a bike decrease by 0.615 for those in Management occupations and 0.368 for those in Professional occupations, compared to those in the reference occupation (Clerical).

CommuteDistance0-1 Miles, CommuteDistance1-2 Miles, and CommuteDistance2-5 Miles are positively associated with the likelihood of purchasing a bike, with estimated coefficients of 0.850, 0.847, and 1.217 respectively. This means that holding all other predictors constant, the log odds of purchasing a bike increase by the corresponding coefficient for each of these categories, compared to those who commute further distances.

YearlyIncome0-25000 and YearlyIncome75001-100000 are negatively associated with the likelihood of purchasing a bike, with estimated coefficients of -1.582 and -1.119 respectively. This means that holding all other predictors constant, the log odds of purchasing a bike decrease by the corresponding coefficient for each of these income categories, compared to those in the reference income category (YearlyIncome25001-50000).

TotalPurchaseYTD, NumberChildrenAtHome, and NumberCarsOwned are negatively associated with the likelihood of purchasing a bike, with estimated coefficients of 0.008, -0.246, and -0.346 respectively. This means that holding all other predictors constant, the log odds of purchasing a bike increase by 0.008 for each unit increase in TotalPurchaseYTD, and decrease by 0.246 and 0.346 for each additional child at home and car owned, respectively.

None of the remaining predictors (Gender, EducationPartial College, EducationPartial High School, OccupationClerical, OccupationManual, OccupationSkilled Manual, CommuteDistance10+ Miles, CommuteDistance5-10 Miles, YearlyIncome50001-75000, YearlyIncomegreater than 100000, HomeOwnerFlag, and Age) show significant associations with the likelihood of purchasing a bike at the 0.05 significance level.
